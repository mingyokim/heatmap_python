This repository contains many files that were used merely used as practice. 

The main files are the following:
	- listings.csv: a csv file containing data of every AirBnB listing in New York City
	- new_york_file.py: python file that parses listings.csv and produces a heatmap, where x-axis is latitude, y-axis is longitude, and z-axis is price of the listing, and is color-coded. Produces the heatmap as new_york_file.png.
	- new_york_file.png: heatmap produced by new_york_file.py
	- new_york_api.py: python file that parses 1000 listings (which is the maximum data extraction that the API allows) extracted from AirBnB API. Same specifications for the heatmap as new_york_file.py, and generates the heatmap in new_york_api.png.
	- new_york_api.png: heatmap produced by new_york_api.py

See issues for the things that can/need to be further implemented.
